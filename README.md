### Requirements 🛠️
- [Cookies](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/cookies/releases)

### Installation 👀

1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/deathmatch/releases).
2. Everything is drag & drop, so i think you can do it!

4. While developing the plugin, I have been using a config with a few settings, that works for a basic Deathmatch/FFA server, if you want to use the same settings as me, use the provided cfg in the archive, if not, make your own settings (cvars).

### Features ✨

* Instant Respawning after death.
* HP Regen on kill.
* Ammo Refill on kill.
* Choosing the guns through a menu (!guns) or through chat commands (!ak47, !m4a4, !m4a1, !deagle, etc)


### Configuring the plugin 🧐

* After installing the plugin, you should change the default prefix from ``addons/swiftly/configs/plugins/deathmatch.json`` and the default translation messages from ``addons/swiftly/translations/translation.deathmatch.json`` (optional).
* To change the value of the HP Regen, edit ``addons/swiftly/configs/plugins/deathmatch.json``.
